- **Section**: Content section wrapper with optional titles

### Step 4: Data types and mock data ✅
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/models.ts`
- Student, Assignment, Submission, AnalysisMetrics, ClassAggregates types
- Seeded mock data generator in `src/data/mock.ts`
- `buildMockDataset()` function with 24 students and 5 assignments
- `computeClassAggregates()` function for KPI calculations

### Step 5: Header and nav ✅

- Student count and latest assignment status
- Quick action buttons for adding assignments and exporting reports
- Three KPI cards showing key metrics

### Step 7: Notifications panel near KPIs ✅
- Notifications panel positioned to the right of KPI cards
- Shows struggling students, anomalous submissions, and missing submissions
- Badge counts and sample names from mock aggregates
- "View all" functionality for each notification type

### Step 8: Student performance table ✅
- Full-width student performance table
- Columns: Name, Latest Assignment, Growth, Formality, Complexity, Grammar/Readability, Alerts
- Search functionality by name
- Column sorting capabilities
- Links to student detail pages

### Step 9: Assignment tracker ✅
- Assignment tracker section with submission rates
- Class average readability calculations
- Outlier flag detection
- Create new assignment button

### Step 10: Custom charts without libraries ✅
- **LineChart**: Custom SVG with tooltips, keyboard navigation, and accessibility
- **BarChart**: Supports grouped and stacked bars with multiple series
- **DonutChart**: Custom SVG with proper proportions and legends
- All charts are responsive with viewBox and preserveAspectRatio
- ARIA labels and keyboard focus support

### Step 11: Trends and visualization section ✅
- Grid layout with three chart cards
- LineChart for readability trends over time
- BarChart for grammar issue counts by type
- DonutChart for tone distribution
- Simple HTML legends matching chart colors

### Step 12: Accessibility and responsiveness ✅
- Skip links and semantic headings implemented
- ARIA-live regions for notifications
- Keyboard navigation across cards, tables, and charts
- Responsive layout: 1 column on small screens, 2+ on large screens
- Notifications panel properly positioned above the fold

### Step 13: Data adapters for future API ✅
- `src/data/adapters.ts` with placeholder async functions
- `fetchClassSummary`, `fetchStudentsPage`, `fetchAssignments`, `fetchTrends`
- Centralized data mapping for easy API integration
- All dashboard data imports from adapters

### Step 14: Students dashboard stub ✅
- Grid of student cards with mock data
- Student name, email, and baseline style profile summary
- Strengths and weaknesses display
- Links to individual student detail pages
- Search functionality

### Step 15: Polish, theming, and QA ✅
- Subtle shadows and rounded corners throughout
- Focus-visible rings for accessibility
- Smooth hover transitions
- Responsive text scaling
- No overflow issues
- Notifications panel properly positioned near KPIs
