Before adding ANY new package or library:
Check if it's absolutely necessary - Can you build it with HTML/CSS/JavaScript instead?
Research known issues - Search GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, recent release notes
Test thoroughly - If it crashes during development, don't commit it
Have a backup plan - Always implement a working fallback first
If you're unsure about a dependency:
Don't add it - Build a custom solution instead
Ask the user - "Should I add this package or build it custom?"
Document the risk - Explain potential issues before proceeding
Remember: A working app with custom code is better than a broken app with external dependencies.
