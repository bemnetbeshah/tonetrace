## 🧪 10.2: Development, Testing, and Launch Workflow

### Dev Flow

1. Scaffold project folder
2. Set up FastAPI, routers, and models
3. Build and test each endpoint as you go
4. Integrate analyzer logic (tone, sentiment, etc.)
5. Use Postman to manually test core flows
6. Write `pytest` unit tests for analyzers and routes
7. Clean up code with `ruff`

### Git Strategy

- Use a `main` branch for stable code
- Develop on `feature/*` branches (e.g., `feature/fingerprint`)
- Commit early and often with meaningful messages
- Push regularly to GitHub

## 🚀 10.3: Deployment Strategy

### Hosting Plan

| Component  | Tool        | Notes                                |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Platform   | Render/Railway | Free-tier friendly for MVP         |
| Backend    | FastAPI     | Served with Uvicorn + Gunicorn      |
| Frontend   | Jinja2      | Bundled into FastAPI app             |
| Database   | SQLite      | Simple + deployable                  |

### Deployment Steps

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect to Render or Railway
3. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set start command: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000`
5. Enable CORS for frontend domain

## 📊 10.4: Post-MVP Metrics & Evaluation

After deploying the MVP, track:

| Metric                        | Target Outcome                 |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| First teacher testing session | ✅ Gather actionable feedback  |
| Core analyzers working        | ✅ Tone/sentiment/structure OK |
| Drift detection runs          | 🟡 Tested manually             |
| Time to deploy MVP            | ⏱️ Within 1–2 weeks            |
| Code structure                | ✅ Modular, tested, readable   |

## 🎯 Final Takeaway

You now have:

- A complete 10-step product plan
- A clear development roadmap
- A real use case with potential impact
- A structure that scales from MVP to product

You're not just building a project — you're creating a foundation for a real, thoughtful tool in education and AI.
